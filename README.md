<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
  We present a neural rendering framework for simultaneous view synthesis and appearance editing of a scene from
  multi-view images captured under known environment illumination. Existing approaches either achieve view synthesis alone or view synthesis along with relighting, without direct control over the sceneâ€™s appearance. Our approach explicitly disentangles the appearance and learns a lighting representation that is independent of it. Specifically, we  independently estimate the BRDF and use it to learn a lighting-only representation of the scene. Such disentanglement allows our approach to generalize to arbitrary changes in appearance while performing view synthesis. We show results of editing the appearance of a real scene, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible appearance editing. The performance of our view synthesisapproach is demonstrated to be at par with state-of-the-art
  approaches on both real and synthetic data.
