abstract = {We present a neural rendering framework for simultaneous view synthesis and appearance editing of a scene with known environmental illumination captured using a mobile camera. Existing approaches either achieve view synthesis alone or view synthesis along with relighting, without control over the scene's appearance. Our approach explicitly disentangles the appearance and learns a lighting representation that is independent of it. Specifically, we jointly learn the scene appearance and a lighting-only representation of the scene. Such disentanglement allows our approach to generalize to arbitrary changes in appearance while performing view synthesis. We show results of editing the appearance of real scenes in interesting and non-trivial ways. The performance of our view synthesis approach is on par with state-of-the-art approaches on both real and synthetic data.},
